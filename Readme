# NFS Server and FUSE Client

A lightweight NFS server implementation with a FUSE client for mounting remote NFS filesystems locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go 1.18 or later
- Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`)
- FUSE development packages
- Go Protocol Buffers plugins

### Installing Dependencies

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
# Install Protocol Buffers compiler
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler

# Install FUSE dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y fuse libfuse-dev

# Install Go Protocol Buffers plugins
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@latest

# Add Go bin directory to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

## Building the Project

```bash
cd nfs-server
make build
```

This will compile the Protocol Buffers definitions and build the server and client binaries.

## Running the NFS Server

To start the NFS server:

```bash
make run-server
# Or directly
./bin/nfsserver -root ./exports -listen :2049
```

The server will export files from the `./exports` directory by default.

## Mounting with FUSE Client

To mount the NFS server's exported directory to a local mount point:

```bash
make run-fuse
# Or directly
./bin/nfs-fuse -mount /tmp/nfs-mount -server localhost:2049
```

You can now access the remote files at `/tmp/nfs-mount`.

## Unmounting the Filesystem

To unmount the FUSE filesystem:

```bash
make unmount-fuse
# Or directly
fusermount -uz /tmp/nfs-mount
```
